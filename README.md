> I do not own the data scraped, I do not have permission to scrape this data. I'd rather use an API, however due to the quick nature of this fun little project, it was not in my best interest to find each API for each website and write adapters for each (and some sites do not offer this).  I'm only scraping these sites once a day ;)
